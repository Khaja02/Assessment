To calculate the product cost for a product in the catalogue, follow these steps:

Define the product details such as name, price, gift wrap status, quantity, and applicable discounts.

Use the calculateDiscount method to determine the discount that applies to the current product purchase.

Use the calculateShippingFee method to calculate the shipping fee based on the total number of units and the specified fee per package.

Use the calculateProductCost method to calculate the total cost of the product purchase, including the applicable discount and shipping fee.

The calculateProductCost method returns an object containing the complete product cost information, which can be displayed to the user.

For example, if you have a product named "Laptop" with a price of 1200, a quantity of 2, and gift wrap requested, you can calculate the product cost using the following code:


var product = "Laptop";
var quantity = 2;
var giftWrap = true;

var result = catalogue.calculateProductCost(product, quantity, giftWrap);

console.log(result);




This code will display the complete product cost information, including the total amount, subtotal, discount applied, shipping fee, gift wrap fee, and the final total.
